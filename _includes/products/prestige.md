Let in the light. Not the heat. Superior comfort and clarity designed to maintain the appearance of your home. Prestige Series films combine lower than glass reflectivity with film options that allow most of the light into your home. Prestige Series films allow 40% to 70% of the natural light into your home. The only thing you'll see day or night, inside or out, is a beautiful window.

Glass windows help make your home beautiful and inviting. But sunlight can create excessive heat and expose your family and possessions to damaging ultraviolet (UV) rays. Let in the light but keep out the heat and damaging UV rays without impacting your home’s aesthetics or your view. Solar heat comes from two primary sources, the visible light you can see and the infrared light you can feel. Prestige Series window films use non-metallized, multi-layer optical film and nano-technology to reject up to 97% of the sun's infrared light and reject up to 60% of the heat coming through your windows. These films also reject up to 99.9% of damaging UV rays to reduce fading of your furnishings. These industry-leading, spectrally-selective films are designed to keep you cool, comfortable and protected. CONSUMER WARRANTY: Selecting 3M Window Films gives you piece of mind.
